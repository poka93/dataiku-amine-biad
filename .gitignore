Predicting Income Brackets from Census Data

Project Overview


This project analyzes demographic and employment data from the US Census to identify the key factors that determine whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 per year. The goal is to build a predictive model that is not only accurate but also interpretable, providing actionable insights into the drivers of income.

This analysis serves as a technical assessment for the Data Scientist role at Dataiku. The focus is on demonstrating a clear, reproducible, and well-documented data science workflow, from initial data exploration to final model interpretation and recommendations, keeping in mind a customer-facing presentation of the results.

Getting Started


To replicate this analysis, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository


	git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
	cd your-repo-name

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.


- Using venv:

	python -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`



3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.


	pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the Analysis

The complete analysis is contained within a Jupyter Notebook.
